    <p>RDRII has been one of the most important Rockstar titles, with an overall rating of 93% for Metacritic. The game is a full-immersion western RPG with an absurd level of complexity (comparable to the Witcher or Fallout), playable in an open world: if you are not familiar with the term, the player has a very wide amount of interactions and does not necessarily have to follow one storyline, but many possible ones according to his decisions within the game.</p><br>
    <h3>System Requirements</h3>
    <p>1. Win 10 and above</p><br>
    <p>2. 8GB above</p><br>
    <p>3. Intel i5 and above</p><br>
    <p>4. 100GB hdd space</p>
